About this repository
--------

This repository contains the source code of PrestaShop 1.6, **now legacy**.

Clicking the "Download ZIP" button from the root of this repository will download a development version of PrestaShop 1.6, not a production ready version.

Note that the ZIP file does not contain the default modules: you need to make a recursive clone using your local Git client in order to download their files too. See [CONTRIBUTING.md][2] for more information about using Git and GitHub.

Also, the ZIP file downloaded from GitHub contains resources for developers and designers that are not in the software installer archive, for instance the SCSS sources files for the default themes (in the /default-bootstrap/sass folder) or the unit testing files (in the /tests folder).

Again, if you want the latest stable version of PrestaShop, go to [the download page][3].

Scope
---------

PrestaShop 1.6.1.x is now in "end of life" state. It means that no further develoment will be done on this old version.

However, there is still shops in this version, and a few interested volunteers from the community agreed to help to create a release if, and only if, a serious problem is identified. This include:

- Security issues
- Supporting PHP 7.2

All issues and pull requests that are not in this list will be closed.

For more details, please read the [1.6.1.X: What’s Next][4] article.
